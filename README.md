This app is deployed to [https://quizler.jacobtread.com/](https://quizler.jacobtread.com/)

Quizler is a real time quiz app I am making which is similar to games like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). The app is
fully real time and uses VueJS for its front-end and has a backend server written in Go; The whole thing communicates
via a WebSocket packet system.

The packet system packet descriptions are available [Here](backend/packets.md)

This repository is a mono-repo it contains the code for both the front-end and back-end of
this application they are stored in sub folders of this repository
