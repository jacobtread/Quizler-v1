Quizler is a real time quiz app I am making which is similar to games like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). The app is
fully real time and uses VueJS for its front-end and has a backend server written in Go; The whole thing communicates
via a WebSocket packet system.

The packet system is ever-changing but the basic packet descriptions are available [Here](./backend/packets.md)

## Showcase

The following gif is a quick overview of the current app progress
